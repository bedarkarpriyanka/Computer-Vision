Completed as part of assignments.

1. Gaussian convolution, Separable convolutions, Laplacian of Gaussian, Histogram equalization.

2. Experimented with SIFT features for scene matching and object recognition.

3. Scene Recognition to classify images into one of the 15 categories. Implemented 2 different image representations: tiny images and bags of SIFT features, and 2 different classification techniques: nearest neighbor and linear SVM.

4. Designed and trained deep convolutional networks for Scene Recognition using PyTorch.

5. Action Recognition using LSTM + CNN Hybrid network on dataset called UCF101. Use the pretrained VGG network to extract features from each frame. With the extracted features, build an LSTM + CNN network which outputs the action label of that sample.
